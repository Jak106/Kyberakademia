1. After going through all files i noticed key4.db which contains key to decrypt passwords

2. Passwords are stored in file logins.json

3. Firefox uses AES-256 encryption for username and password, i downloaded FirefoxMaster tools which helped me decrypt it

4. After decryption i got flag: ```flag{readcted}```
