1. After opening file in Ghidra i noticed main and decrypt functions

2. In main the code is comparing user input with the result of decrypt function.

3. I rewrote the code into python, after launching python code i got password for the ```ReverzniMa2.exe``` file. 

4. After entering the password, file returns flag: ```redacted```
